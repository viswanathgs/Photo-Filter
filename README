A simple Facebook App that allows the user to enter a bunch of friends and 
filters photos in which the user is tagged with them. The idea was conceived during a
mini-hackathon at Facebook's Hyderabad office.

The app is available at https://apps.facebook.com/photo-filter

Written using Facebook's PHP SDK v3.0.0 and JQuery 1.7.1. 
Thanks to James Smith for 'loopj TokenInput', a Facebook-style autocomplete 
plugin (http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/).
